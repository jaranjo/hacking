# Bandit Level 4
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the `inhere` directory. 
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

Steps:

1. Open the terminal and enter ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org.
1. Enter the password from the previous level.
1. `cd inhere`
1. `ls -Ual`
1. `cat ./-file07` (I gathered this by printing file outputs to the terminal until one printed something readable.)
1. Copy and/or store the password printed to the terminal.
