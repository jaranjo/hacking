# Bandit Level 20
## Level Goal

To gain access to the next level, you should use the `setuid` binary in the home directory. 
Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. 
The password for this level can be found in the usual place (`/etc/bandit_pass`), after you have used the `setuid` binary.

Steps:
1. `ls -l`
1. `./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20`
