# Bandit Level 18
## Level Goal
There are 2 files in the home directory: `passwords.old` and `passwords.new`. 
The password for the next level is in `passwords.new` and is the only line that has been changed between `passwords.old` and `passwords.new`.

NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into `bandit18`, this is related to the next level, `bandit19`.

Steps:
1. `diff passwords.old passwords.new`
